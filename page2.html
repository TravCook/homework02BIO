      <h2>Competitive Gaming</h2>
      <p id="par1">I first found competitive gaming in my first year of college when I starting playing League of Legends. I had played it casually for some time, but when the first on-campus tournament was announced I couldn't say no. I signed up, and we were all assigned our teams at random. It was a single elimination bracket and my team managed to make it all the way to the finals. We faced the only "pre-made" team that entered the tournament in the finals. Every team they faced along the way told us the same thing, "man those guys are tough, good luck getting even an inch on them." It was a best of three games, game one had started rocky, and ultimately led to our downfall. But we regrouped, and by game two we were working like a team again. We won game two without too much difficulty, and that's when it set in. We could do this! So we dug in, game three was a battle, and after an hour long effort, we won. I had helped win the first ever tournament I had entered. Well, after that, I was hooked. I was looking into other competitive games to play and found what I would call my favorite competitive game of all time. Super Smash Brothers Melee, it was originally released on the Nintendo Gamecube, but with the way technology advances, we can play it on desktop computers now. I begun playing nightly, and entering the local tournaments every week. It was one of the best times of my life, I made so many good friends and great memories. During that time, my training parter and close friend DJ had gotten me into Rocket League. He told me all about how Dreamhack was coming to Denver soon and we just HAD to enter into the Rocket League tournament and the Melee tournament.</p>
