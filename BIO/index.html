    <p id="par1">Born and raised in beautiful Northern Colorado, I have lived a wonderful life full of opportunity. I was able to take a semester of Computer Science at Colorado State University. However, I quickly came to the conclusion that I was not ready for higher education just yet. I decided to take on the workforce to try to find myself in this world. I worked for about 6 years in food service, managing a Jimmy John's for about 4 years of that time. After that I moved into production, I worked in a vinyl window and patio door factory for about 2 years. It was very physical and very rewarding, however, a larger corporation had bought out our factory and starting making changes that I did not agree with. After standing up for my coworkers and asking management for better treatment, I was met with a phone call that I had been let go. So I have decided to re-try my passion of computer science and develpment and that is what has led me here today.</p>
